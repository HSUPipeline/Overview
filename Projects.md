## Place Cell Methods

The place cell methods uses simulations, human data, and rodent data to examine properties of
place cell detection methods. An overview of the place cell methods project is available in the
[project repository](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/PlaceCellMethods).

Associated repositories:
- [SimPlaceCells](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/Analyze_RAThc3/)
    - A repository for simulating place cells.
- [AnalyzeTrain](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/AnalyzeTrain/)
    - A repository for analyzing Train data.
- [AnalyzeRatHC3](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/Analyze_RAThc3/)
    - A repository for analyzing rat data from the HC3 dataset.

## Treasure Hunt

Treasure Hunt (TH) is a spatial navigation and memory task. A recent project using the TH task with
human single-neuron recordings uses the pipeline and has publicly available data & code.

Associated repositories:
- [ConvertTH](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/ConvertTH)
    - A repository for converting TH data to NWB format.
- [AnalyzeTH](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/AnalyzeTH)
    - A repository for analyzing TH data.
